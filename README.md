**Video Description:**  

Welcome to **Electronic for Everyone**! 🎉  

In this video, we’re building a **smart night light** that reacts to temperature changes:  
🌡️ **Dynamic Color Adjustment:**  
- Blue for cool temperatures.  
- Green for comfortable temperatures.  
- Red for hot temperatures.  

✨ **Additional Features:**  
- **Manual Mode:** Set a fixed white or yellow light.  
- **Turn Off Mode:** Easily switch off the light or display.  
- **Digital Temperature Display:** Monitor the room temperature in real-time.  
- **Hidden Touch Buttons:** Seamlessly control the light and display functions with two hidden touch-sensitive buttons for a sleek design.  

📌 **Perfect for Beginners:** This project uses an Arduino, a temperature sensor, LEDs, and a digital display—all explained step by step.
